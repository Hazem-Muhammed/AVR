# AVR

 In this repository we can mainly find several AVR-based Embedded application based on layered-architecture software. Starting from the MCAL layer to the APP layer.
 
 # The MCAL layer includes:
 * Definitions of standard datatypes and Bitwise operations 
 * Definitions of the accessed registers of the target MCU (ATMEGA32a) 
 * Configuration of the I/O peripheral ports 
 * ADC Module 
 * TMR0, TMR1, and TMR2 Modules with different modes, CCP (Capture Compare PWM)
 * Interrupt configuration and Interrupt vectors for EXT0,EXT1,EXT1,ADC, TMR0,TMR1,and TMR2
 
 
 # The HAL layer includes:
 * LED interface 
 * Push Button module 
 * Buzzer module 
 * LCD module 
 * Keypad module 
 * 4 digits multiplexed seven-segment display 

Those are implemented for the sake of different applications layer.
